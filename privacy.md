# Privacy Policy for Wardrobe

Last updated: February 26, 2024

At Wardrobe, one of our main priorities is the privacy of our users. This Privacy Policy document outlines the types of information that are collected, stored, or shared by Wardrobe and how we use it.

## Data Storage Policy

Wardrobe stores certain information directly on your device to enhance your user experience. This includes your virtual wardrobe configurations, preferences, and settings. Storing this data on your device allows for a personalized and efficient use of the Wardrobe app without the need for an internet connection.

## Data Collection for TestFlight

For users participating in our TestFlight program, Wardrobe collects data necessary to understand usage patterns, app performance, and to identify areas for improvement. This data collection is crucial for testing pre-release versions of the app and ensuring that Wardrobe meets our users' needs and expectations. Participation in the TestFlight program is voluntary, and all collected data is used strictly for app development purposes.

## Third-Party Service Providers

Wardrobe does not employ third-party companies or individuals due to our strict no data collection policy for the general use of the app. However, for TestFlight participants, we may share anonymized data with third-party service providers for the sole purpose of improving the app. These third parties are prohibited from using your personal information for any other purpose.

## Security

We strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting the data stored within the app, as well as any data collected from TestFlight participants. While we are committed to securing your data, remember that no method of electronic storage or transmission over the internet is 100% secure.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

Wardrobe may update its Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted.
